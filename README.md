## About This Repo
Hello! 👋 Welcome to **AlyssaDataHub**! 
This repository space is dediated to exploring and understanding the world of data. Created January 7th, 2025, this repo serves as both a learning journey for myself and a resource hub for others who are building their foundation in data-related fields. 

## What You'll Find Here

* 📚 **Cheat Sheets**
  -A collection of building blocks and essential actions for tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and more, designed to serve as a quick-reference dictionary for mastering each tool.
* 💻 **Projects**
  -Practical examples and case studies showcasing real-world applications of data analytics and other data-related disciplines.
* 📎 **Resources**
  - A collection of links to videos, articles, and other materials that I found helpful throughout my learning journey, curated to support others in exploring and building their data skills.

## Why I created this Repo
I believe a strong foundation is key to mastering any subject, and this repository reflescts my efforts to develop a comprehensive understanding of **all things data**. My goal is to create a space where complex topics are simplified and made accessible to everyone whether you are just beginning your data journey or are looking to refine your skills. 

## 🌱 I’m Currently Working On ...
Currently I am working on solidifying my expertise in data analytics with an emphasis on tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**. I am creating worksheets and projects to emphasize practical applications and real world scenarios to help myself build confidence in these essential tools. 

## 🔭 Future Work
Eventually, I would like to expand my knowledge to cover the entire data ecosystem, These areas include:

* **Data Science**
  * (My college major!) I plan to go over the basic machine learning processes in detail, apply them to real world scenarios and better understand the mathematics behind each
* **Data Engineering**
  -I aim to explore the foundations of building data pipelines, managing data storage systems, and ensuring data is available and optimized for analysis.
* **Data Architecture**
  -My focus will be on understanding how to design and structure efficient systems for storing, organizing, and integrating large datasets.
* **Buisness Intellegence**
  -I plan to delve into techniques for turning raw data into actionable insights using visualization tools, dashboards, and strategic analysis.
  
Ulitmately I aim to create a well rounded repository to reflect my growth as a data professional while providing valueable resources for anyone to helo others discover the exciting and dynamic woeld of data.

## About me 🙋‍♀️
Hi, I'm Alyssa Juarez! I'm a **Winter 2024 graduate** with a degree in **Data Science** concentrating in **Mathematics** from the **University of Texas at Arlington**. My academic background has provided me a strong foundation with **statistic**s and **data modeling**. Though I have studied these subjects extensively, I believe there is alywas room for improvement and further learning.

As a highly organized and detail oriented individual, my main drivinf factor is to push myself to be better. As Ernest Hemingway once said, "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self." I strive to embody this philosphy every day by embracing growth, remaining open to new oppurtunities and continuously seeking ways to improve. 

Through AlyssaDataHub, I aim to showcase my skills, document my learning journey, and contribute valuable resources to the data community. I hope this space sparks curiosity, encourages learning, anf helps others feel confident as they dive into the world of data. Lets make data fun, approachable, and something to get excited about!
