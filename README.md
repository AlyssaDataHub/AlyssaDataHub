* 📚 **Cheat Sheets**  
  - A collection of building blocks and essential actions for tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and more, designed to serve as a quick-reference dictionary for mastering each tool.  
* 💻 **Projects**  
  - Practical examples and case studies showcasing real-world applications of data analytics and other data-related disciplines.  
* 📎 **Resources**  
  - A collection of links to videos, articles, and other materials that I found helpful throughout my learning journey, curated to support others in exploring and building their data skills.  

## Why I Created This Repo  
I believe a strong foundation is key to mastering any subject, and this repository reflects my efforts to develop a comprehensive understanding of **all things data**. My goal is to create a space where complex topics are simplified and made accessible to everyone, whether you are just beginning your data journey or are looking to refine your skills.  

## 🌱 I’m Currently Working On ...  
Currently, I am working on solidifying my expertise in data analytics with an emphasis on tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**. I am creating worksheets and projects to emphasize practical applications and real-world scenarios to help myself build confidence in these essential tools.  

## 🔭 Future Work  
Eventually, I would like to expand my knowledge to cover the entire data ecosystem. These areas include:  

* **Data Science**  
  * (My college major!) I plan to go over the basic machine learning processes in detail, apply them to real-world scenarios, and better understand the mathematics behind each.  
* **Data Engineering**  
  - I aim to explore the foundations of building data pipelines, managing data storage systems, and ensuring data is available and optimized for analysis.  
* **Data Architecture**  
  - My focus will be on understanding how to design and structure efficient systems for storing, organizing, and integrating large datasets.  
* **Business Intelligence**  
  - I plan to delve into techniques for turning raw data into actionable insights using visualization tools, dashboards, and strategic analysis.  

Ultimately, I aim to create a well-rounded repository to reflect my growth as a data professional while providing valuable resources to help others discover the exciting and dynamic world of data.

Whether you're here to learn, explore, or polish up your skills, I hope you find AlyssaDataHub to be a welcoming and inspiring place. Let’s grow our data skills together!  

## About Me 🙋‍♀️  
Hi, I'm Alyssa Juarez! I'm a **December 2024 graduate** with a **Bachelor of Science** in **Data Science** concentrating in **Mathematics** from the **University of Texas at Arlington**. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in **statistics** and **data modeling**. Though I have studied these subjects extensively, I believe there is always room for improvement and further learning.  

As a highly organized and detail-oriented individual, my main driving factor is to push myself to be better. As Ernest Hemingway once said, "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self." I strive to embody this philosophy every day by embracing growth, remaining open to new opportunities, and continuously seeking ways to improve.  

Through AlyssaDataHub, I aim to showcase my skills, document my learning journey, and contribute valuable resources to the data community. I hope this space sparks curiosity, encourages learning, and helps others feel confident as they explore the world of data. Let’s make data fun, approachable, and something to get excited about!
